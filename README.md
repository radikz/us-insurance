# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs

The goal with this project will be to analyze various attributes within **insurance.csv** to learn more about the user information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.

**insurance.csv** contains the following columns:
* Patient Age
* Patient Sex 
* Patient BMI
* Patient Number of Children
* Patient Smoking Status
* Patient U.S Geopraphical Region
* Patient Yearly Medical Insurance Cost

There are no signs of missing data. To store this information, seven empty lists will be created hold each individual column of data from **insurance.csv**.

The following operations will be implemented:
* Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.
* Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from.
* Return the number of smokers vs. non-smokers counted in the dataset
* Analyze the smokers then grouping based on the age of users
* creating a dictionary that contains all patient information
